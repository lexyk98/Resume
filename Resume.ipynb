    "I have one year of experience working as a Biomedical Engineer at Trius Medical Sales and Services, located in Trinidad and Tobago.            \n",
    "\n",
    "My role began during the peak of the pandemic, where I learned to work in a fast-paced environment, and under pressure.  \n",
    "During this time, my responsibilities were not limited to the biomedical sector, but also the entire engineering department.      \n",
    "\n",
    "This included scheduling and maintaining all engineering jobs while pursuing my role as a Biomedical Engineer. \n",
    "This strengthened my leadership and managerial skills, which allows me to work both in a team and independently. \n",
    "Throughout 2023, I used the time to transition from an engineering perspective to a data science perspective.  \n",
    "Technology is rapidly advancing, with endless data to be encapsulated and used to solve problems. \n",
    "\n",
    "I would like the chance to apply myself in the Data Science field. \n",
    "A little insight about myself is that I resigned from my previous role as a Biomedical Engineer and took the opportunity to move to the US. \n",
    "\n",
    "Prior to the termination of my previous role, I volunteered to train the present Biomed at the company and ensure that my duties were fulfilled. I am currently a store manager at a tech store, which has greatly improved my customer service, communication, and organizational skills.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Even though my background is Biomedical Technology, I have had to be analytical and apply critical thinking throughout my past and present roles. I think this is the key to assess data science projects. \n",
    "Most of all, I am determined to be the best that I can be in favor of the company.     \n",
